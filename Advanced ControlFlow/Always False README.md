There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. It will contain a few steps:
Define the function to accept a single parameter called num
Use a combination of <, > and and to create a contradiction in an if statement.
If the condition is true, return True, otherwise return False. The trick here is that because we’ve written a contradiction, the condition should never be true, so we should expect to always return False.
