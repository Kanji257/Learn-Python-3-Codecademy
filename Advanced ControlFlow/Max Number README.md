For the final challenge, we are going to select which number from three input values is the greatest using conditional statements. To do this, we need to check the different combinations of values to see which number is greater than the other two. Here is what we need to do:
Define a function that has three input parameters, num1, num2, and num3
Test if num1 is greater than the other two numbers If so, return num1
Test if num2 is greater than the other two numbers If so, return num2
Test if num3 is greater than the other two numbers If so, return num3
If there was a tie between the two largest numbers, then return "It's a tie!"
