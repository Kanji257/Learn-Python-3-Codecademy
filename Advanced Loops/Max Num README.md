Here is a more traditional coding problem for you. This function will be used to find the maximum number in a list of numbers. This can be accomplished using the max() function in python, but #as a challenge, we are going to manually implement this function. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept a list of numbers called nums
Set our default maximum value to be the first element in the list
Loop through every number in the list of numbers
Within the loop, if we find a number greater than our starting maximum, then replace the maximum with what we found.
Return the maximum number
